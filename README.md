# SRB2Kart (Snowy Build)

This modification of [SRB2Kart](https://kartkrew.org/) was made for just one reason: Boredom. (And well, Vanilla SRB2 already had [one](https://github.com/JadenArcm/Snowy-Vanilla/) before this, so...)

## What's new?
> - HUD Enhancements.
> - Vanilla SRB2 console behavior.
> - Custom resolutions. ***(Command parameters)***
> - Improved Menus. ***(Lowercase, more organized.)***
> - Callmore's character select screen, with some small changes.
> - Server preview before connecting. ***(Unfinished, lol)***

There may be more features, but who knows what those will be?
